## CodeProject is a community of software developers joined together with certain common goals: to learn, to teach, and to have fun. members from all over the world come together to share code, tutorials, and knowledge for free to help their fellow software developers.

### However, CodeProject’s forums are being overrun with spam questions from beginners who don’t care to first do a Google search. The amount of spam on the website is more than can be manually filtered through.

Create a model, which when given various details about a question and the account, can predict whether the question should be deleted, and also predict the reason for deletion (from a small set of standard reasons i.e multiclass classification).

The classes for the target are

### 0: "valid",
### 1: "kehna kya chahte ho"
### 2: "irrelevant"
### 3: "low quality"
### 4: "not reproducible"

Note: Why we would have loved to include the tags directly in the dset, Kaggle's implementation of Macro F1 Score expects numeric labels. So the labels are numeric in nature.

EDIT: Kaggle is messing up the data display here. Please find the data at:
